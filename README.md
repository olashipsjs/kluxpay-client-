component-based UI, and **TypeScript** for type safety.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using token token rotation
  **JWT** Json Web Token and Cookies.
- **Crypto Transactions**: Buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency assets directly
  in-app.
- **Real-Time Price Updates**: Live data feeds for tracking crypto prices and
  market trends.
- **Account Management**: User profile, transaction history, and account
  settings.
- **Optimized Performance**: Server-side rendering with Astro and dynamic
  updates with React.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro** - A performant static site generator for SSR and content rendering.
